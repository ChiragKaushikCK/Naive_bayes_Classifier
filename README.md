## <a id="about-the-project"></a> ðŸ“š About The Project

This project demonstrates the application of the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** algorithm for a classification task. The goal is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their interaction with social network advertisements. The notebook covers essential steps in a machine learning workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## <a id="features"></a> âœ¨ Features

* **Data Loading & Initial Inspection**: Loads the `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset and performs basic checks.
* **Feature and Target Separation**: Clearly distinguishes independent variables (features) from the dependent variable (target).
* **Data Splitting**: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
* **Feature Scaling**: Applies `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms and can improve the performance of many machine learning models.
* **Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation**: Trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed data.
* **Prediction and Evaluation**: Generates predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## <a id="dataset"></a> ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`. It typically contains information about users, including their age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a particular product after seeing a social network ad.

**Columns:**
* `Age`
* `EstimatedSalary`
* `Purchased` (Target Variable: 0 for No, 1 for Yes)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
After training and evaluating the Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the test set, the following performance metrics were observed:

Accuracy Score: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90.0%.

Confusion Matrix:

[[65  3]
 [ 5 27]]
